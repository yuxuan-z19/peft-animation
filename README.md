We are creating an animation of the PEFT algorithms and strategies listed in [Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lIsCS8b6zj), and we will release science communication videos in the future. Stay tuned to the [Tsinghua University Students' Association of Algorithm](https://space.bilibili.com/482959881).
